			<li><b>Incomplete/Partial Verification: </b>
			<p>In the last few years, the market evolution has evidenced the necessity to adapt software development processes to the new turbulent environment where user 
			requirements and software technologies constantly change. In this context, a primary goal is to reduce the delay between design decisions and feedbacks from users. 
			For this reason, software development processes have been evolving from rigid, pre-specified, and sequential to agile, incremental, and iterative. 
			More precisely, in these processes, the final software is obtained through the development of 
			a sequence of partial products (increments), which are self-containing units of software that represent specific features of the final system.
			</p>
			
			<p>Although there have been surprising improvements that led to the development of efficient model checkers, the available mainstream techniques are not directly
			applicable to incomplete and evolving specifications in which some parts may change over time. Most existing model-checking approaches require a complete re-check 
			of the system against its requirements every time a part of the software is changed. If changes are frequent, formal verification becomes a bottleneck of the 
			development process. For these reasons model-checking techniques must be equipped to accommodate incremental and iterative verification.
			</p>
			<p>Incremental and iterative verification concerns in a sequence of consecutive verification steps, which allow to verify software while its different parts are 
			designed and developed. To this aim, the algorithm needs to generate and re-use information previously inferred, in a way to minimize the current and the future effort. 
			The main idea is that when something changes, is it not necessary to verify the whole system from scratch, but it is possible to isolate the components that are subject 
			to the change, and use the information previously generated (e.g., the constraints that a sub-component must satisfy) to infer the properties that hold in the whole 
			system. 
			</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Adaptive Security: </b>
			
			<p>Security systems protect data and resources against unauthorized modifications, accesses, and disclosures. At the same time they must guarantee the availability 
			of assets to the legitimate users. Engineering secure systems concerns identifying an adequate set of security controls to protect critical assets from unauthorized 
			disclosures. The identification of this set of security controls highly depends on the location of the assets to be protected and on the topology of the building 
			(or structure of the system) that need to be protected. 
			</p>
			<p>In this context, adaptation plays a key role. Changes in the values of the assets or in their locations can render existing security controls no longer effective.
			For example, moving a valuable asset from a room to another may break its security. The system must be able to react to these changes. In the previous example, one 
			possibility is to apply more restrictive security controls to the room in which the asset is moved, such as by neglecting the access to some categories of users, or 
			to regulate the access on the area in which the room is located. The set of security controls that can be applied obviously depends on the set of functional and security 
			requirements that the system must satisfy.
